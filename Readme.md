# ETH AOS/Bluebottle System Sources

This is the source code of the last stable release of the ETH AOS/Bluebottle System, dated March 12, 2004, in plain ISO 8859-1 UTF-8 text files.

The following ZIP files with the source code have been downloaded from [the archived bluebottle.ethz.ch website](https://web.archive.org/web/20040802232503/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch/dllatest.html) on 2023-12-29.

The last [archive snapshot of the bluebottle.ethz.ch website](https://web.archive.org/web/20110524062849/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch/index.html) was on 2011-05-24. In the next snapshot by 2011-07-06, the name "Bluebottle" was replaced by "A2". Already starting from the 2009-04-01 archive snapshot the download menu pointed to the A2 Revision 2081 (February 19, 2009). Finally, in 2014 the website bluebottle.ethz.ch didn't exist any longer, but was redirected to a2.ethz.ch.

The release downloaded here was accessible [from the bluebottle.ethz.ch website](https://web.archive.org/web/20080612004107/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch:80/index.html) in unchanged form until 2008-06-12 under the [Download Current](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122329/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch/dllatest.html) link. Also the [referenced change log](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122329/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch/downloads/current/WebAos.html) ends on 2004-03-12.

There were some later releases called "Crazy-Fresh", described as "Never tested, never booted but as fresh as it can be"; the latest one from 2007-07-23 [can be accessed from here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011134937/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch:80/dlcrazy.html). 

By the end of 2005, the main contributors of the AOS/Bluebottle system (Pieter Johannes Muller, Patrik Reali and Thomas Martin Frey) were no longer at ETH, which is likely the reason why there was no later "Current" release.
